# Seed treatment project details
Seed treatment data analysis - growth chamber, greenhouse, and field data

Data files:

Growth chamber: settings were 200-500 umol/m2/sec light, 70-80% RH, 14:10 (L:D), 21:18C (D:N)

1. First round of germination tests for tall fescue and kentucky bluegrass "R1 Germination tests_Raw_02172021.csv"
2. Second round of germination tests for tall fescue "R2GermDataFescueOnly.csv" - decided not to do weights for bluegrass because there were no differences?
#this has data for shoot and root weights, and the ratio, and germination out of 100 seeds per rep (300 seeds per treatment)
3. Beauveria seed treatment germination "R1 GC Bb.csv" - germination counts only, rp.no is the assigned number for each roll paper (12 per treatment), box is the storage container number for each roll paper and was randomly assigned, shelf is the location that each box was on (1 being the top, 2 is the middle, 3 is the bottom)
4. Metarhizium seed treatment germination "R2 germ (new w/staggered stop).csv" was the first set of counts for the metarhizium, but the spores were old so we redid the treatments and counted germination again
5. Testing the newer cultured Metarhizium "New Met GC.csv"
#this has only the germination counts for tall fescue and kentucky bluegrass treated with new Met spores, 

Greenhouse: settings were 70-80% RH, 14:10 (L:D), 25:15C (D:N)
 - overseeded with standard turf rates, started on 5/24/2021
 - destructively harvested subsamples over 3 timepoints (4, 6, 8 weeks post planting). 
 - clipped pots weekly to 3in, collected clippings and air dried. Added clipping weight to dried shoot weight at harvest for total shoot biomass. 
 - harvested roots for biomass
 - kept soil for EPF bioassays at each timepoint

1. Beauveria seed treatments on tall fescue and kentucky bluegrass "R1 GH BB.csv" - didnt finish with bluegrass sampling, so only using TF data
2. Met seed treatments on tall fescue and kentucky bluegrass "R1 GH Met.csv" - only analyzing TF data
3. "BbTFgalleriaInf.csv" is the file for all the tf Beauveria seed treatment galleria infection data
4. "MetTFgalleriaClean.csv" for Metarhizium seed treatment infection data

Field: Project began in September 2021. Field was sampled every 3-4 months for infection (Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Summer 2022, Fall 2022)
Fertilized on 11/12/2021 and 9/13/2022 with Sunday "Mighty Green" 26-0-2
Kyle applied weed & feed on

Bioassays:
1. baseline field EPF - soil sample taken on 9/20/2021 from field margins
2. fall 2021 field bioassay "EPF_field_redo.csv" - had to redo with the soils because of high pupation in the first bioassay, soil sampled on 11/10/2021
3. spring 2022 bioassay "spring 22 field bioassay.csv" - soil sample taken on 5/1/2022
4. summer 2022 bioassay "summer22 epf bioassay.csv" - soil sample taken around 7/25/2022
5. fall 2022 bioassay "fall 2022 epf bioassay.csv" - sampled on 10/18/2022

Line intersect analysis:
1. fall LIA done on 11/8/2021 - need to find this data sheet
2. spring LIA done on 5/8/2022 "spring22LIA.csv"
