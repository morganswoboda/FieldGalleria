Seed treatment field galleria analysis

This analysis is for the field Galleria infection data from the seed treatment project.

Project began in September 2021. Field was sampled every 3-4 months for infection (Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Summer 2022, Fall 2022)

Data files:

Growth chamber: settings were 200-500 umol/m2/sec light, 70-80% RH, 14:10 (L:D), 21:18C (D:N)

1. First round of germination tests for tall fescue and kentucky bluegrass "R1 Germination tests_Raw_02172021.csv"
2. Second round of germination tests for tall fescue "R2GermDataFescueOnly.csv" - decided not to do weights for bluegrass because there were no differences?
#this has data for shoot and root weights, and the ratio, and germination out of 100 seeds per rep (300 seeds per treatment)
3. Beauveria seed treatment germination "R1 GC Bb.csv" - germination counts only, rp.no is the assigned number for each roll paper (12 per treatment), box is the storage container number for each roll paper and was randomly assigned, shelf is the location that each box was on (1 being the top, 2 is the middle, 3 is the bottom)
4. Metarhizium seed treatment germination "R2 germ (new w/staggered stop).csv" was the first set of counts for the metarhizium, but the spores were old so we redid the treatments and counted germination again
5. Testing the newer cultured Metarhizium "New Met GC.csv"
#this has only the germination counts for tall fescue and kentucky bluegrass treated with new Met spores,
